            Difference between SQL and NoSQL?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-400">
            SQL is RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS) &
            NoSQL is Non-relational or distributed database system.
            SQL databases are efficient at processing queries and joining data across tables, making it easier to perform complex queries against structured data, including ad hoc requests. NoSQL databases lack consistency across products and typically require more work to query data, particular as query complexity increases.Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS-SQL Server etc.Examples: MongoDB, GraphQL, HBase, Neo4j, Cassandra etc</p>
